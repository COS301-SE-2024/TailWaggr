| Nicholas Harvey    |        Dev Ops Engineer         | I have a lot of interest in the future of technology and how it might impact the world, especially the use of AI in a supportive capacity to assist people in their endeavours to enhance productivity more than using either AI or people could accomplish alone. This interest has led to me developing a passion for programming, especially the more mathematically and data-oriented side of things - and thus, I tend to work best in a backend capacity.                                                                           | ![Nicholas Harvey](assets/team/Nicholas_Harvey.png)       | [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-Profile-blue?logo=linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-harvey-b11455144/) |
